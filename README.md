## Introduction

TicTacTurbo is a web application that brings a dynamic and engaging multiplayer experience to the classic tic-tac-toe game. With real-time interaction powered by Socket.io, players can challenge each other, test their strategies, and have fun together. The application is built using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and Express.js as the web application framework.

## Technologies Used

TicTacTurbo is built using the following technologies:

- React.js: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based approach allows for efficient and reusable UI components.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side development. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it well-suited for scalable web applications.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the development of server-side applications and enables routing and middleware integration.
- Socket.io: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. Socket.io is used to power the interactive multiplayer functionality in TicTacTurbo.

## Architecture

TicTacTurbo follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend and backend communicating over HTTP and WebSocket protocols. Here's an overview of the architecture:

- **Frontend**: The frontend of TicTacTurbo is built using React.js. It handles the user interface, rendering the game board, and updating the UI based on user interactions. Socket.io enables real-time communication with the server, allowing for multiplayer functionality.
- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It handles game logic, player matchmaking, and data persistence. Socket.io facilitates real-time communication between players, ensuring a seamless multiplayer experience.

The client-server communication flow in TicTacTurbo is as follows:

1. The client (web browser) sends HTTP requests to the server to load the initial game interface.
2. The server responds with the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.
3. The client renders the game board and establishes a WebSocket connection with the server using Socket.io.
4. When a player makes a move, the client sends the move details to the server over the WebSocket connection.
5. The server validates the move, updates the game state, and broadcasts the updated state to all connected players.
6. The clients receive the updated game state and reflect it in the UI, allowing players to see each other's moves in real-time.
7. The process continues until a player wins the game or it ends in a draw.
